> The open source IMS has been designed and built as a minimum viable system, meeting the common and priority needs of councils. Here we example some of the current features of the system.

## Dashboard

This is the landing page once logged in. The dashboard shows widgets which provide a summary of what’s happening in the system. Currently there are widgets for import processing.  
 
## Transaction list - search page 

All payments are shown in real-time, as soon as they have been received. Payments can be searched for, when dealing with a query from a customer, and there are multiple filtering options. The narrative search option, which may contain information such as a payee sort code or account number, has proved particularly useful to IMS users at Barnsley.  
 
## Transaction details 
Payment information is provided, and with a full audit trail. There is functionality to email and print receipts. Payments can be refunded and journalled. Where needed payments can be reallocated, to a correct fund and reference. 
 
## Transfers

Transfers permit money to be moved, when it isn’t linked to a payment coming into the system. For example, a customer's council tax account might be in credit after an award of council tax support. 
 
## Payments 

A call centre or post room can take card payments and record cheques that have been received. When clicking ‘pay’ a member of staff is guided through the payment process. This can be used for return direct debits, direct debit indemnity claims and returned cheques. Multiple items can be processed. The feature integrates with call management software.
    
## eReturns

eReturns are configured using templates and used to record cashing up with cash and cheque. 
      
## Accounts

Are primarily used to validate account references.
      
## Suspense

When a bank file is imported most entries will be allocated automatically, any item not allocated falls into suspense. You can add notes to show any progress that's been made whilst working on a suspense item. 
 
## Imports

Breakdown of all file imports into the IMS are shown. Transactions created can be viewed. Import reversals are on the IMS product backlog. 
 
## Import processing rules

Allow a user to define rules and actions to perform on imported transactions, which reduces the amount of items going into suspense.
      
## Configurable settings

It’s possible to set-up configurable data within the system, such as fund codes, VAT codes and methods of payments.
