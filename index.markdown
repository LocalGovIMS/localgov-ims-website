The LocalGov IMS is an open-source income management system built by local government for local government.

LocalGov IMS is intuitive, easy to maintain, enhance, and free to use. It provides a comprehensive way to manage payments and accounting across council departments.

The system was built by local government teams who know about the needs, expectations, and challenges faced by other similar organisations.

By engaging with other councils throughout the delivery of the IMS, the system has been designed to reflect the needs of the teams who will use it. 

## Getting involved and using the IMS 

If you’re a council you can begin using the IMS and [join the IMS community](https://localgovims.slack.com). The IMS community understands the value of sharing technology and knowledge, working together, and in the open.

### Accessing the demo site

If you’d like to access the IMS demo site we ask that you identify a lead user from your council. The lead user can visit the [demo log-in screen](/demo), and register for access with their council email address. The IMS team will then set-up the lead user and provide access. 

If you’d like to set up additional users in bulk, the IMS team can do this for you, please [contact the team](/contact) to arrange this. 

The IMS team is also happy to introduce you to the system, please contact the team if you’d like an introduction to the IMS. 

### Downloading the source code

If you’d like to start using the IMS codebase you can [download the source code here](https://github.com/localgovims). Read the [IMS Memorandum of Understanding](/documentation) for more information about using the IMS.

### First time use for Finance teams

If you’re part of a finance team and would like a guided introduction to using the IMS, the IMS project team can run a dedicated session for your council. Please [contact the team](/contact) to arrange this.
