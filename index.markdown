We have created a free, reusable and open source income management system that’s easy to use, maintain and enhance. It provides a comprehensive way to manage payments and accounting across all your departments.

# Why should you switch?

Our system was built by a local authority who knows how it needs to be used and what challenges it could face. 

As more local authorities have started to use it, we have been able to fine tune the system to make it more robust and perform the tasks needed by all the service users in the organisation. 

We believe in sharing knowledge and so our system is available free of charge if you have internal capability or if you need support hosting or implementing, the cost will still be significantly less than your existing contract. In the current financial climate we all understand the importance of making budgets stretch further and empowering internal teams. 

Come and join a network of like minded people who all see the value of sharing knowledge and saving money. 

# Meet the team

This is an open, collaborative local authority project funded by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MCHLG) Local Digital Fund, and led collaboratively by partners. 

The current partners on the project are Dorset Council, Barnsley Metropolitan and Borough Council and Lewisham Council. The team is supported by a delivery partner, dxw and a DLUHC engagement manager. 

Richard Kingston, digital programme manager at Barnsley Council comments, “ We initially created the system for our use at Barnsley, but to make this IMS something that other councils can use, we decided to build in other functionality too with the goal of making it open source. That way, we have an IMS that has been created by local government, for local government. We hope this is an approach that others can follow with different services.”

Glen Conroy, ICT operations manager at Dorset Council adds, “People only notice an IMS when it’s not working. Either payments get taken, or they don’t.  Having this in place will make a huge difference to the smooth running of the system in any council, ensuring the flow of payments from citizens and around the council is seamless and efficient.”
