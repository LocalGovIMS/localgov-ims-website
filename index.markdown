# What do we do?

We offer a viable and sustainable alternative to the current market offerings for income management systems, for local authorities and public sector bodies. Our vision is to build a free, reusable and open source income management system, for the public good, that's easy and affordable to maintain and enhance.

# Who are we?
            
This is an open, collaborate local authority project funded by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Culture (DLUHC) Local Digital Fund, and led by collaboratively by partners. The current partners are Barnsley Council, Dorset Council and Lewisham Council. The team are supported by a delivery partner, dxw and a DLUHC engagement manager.

# What are benefits of switching to this service?

This service was built by a local authority who knows how it needs to be used and what challenges are faced. As more local authorities use it, we have been able to fine tune the system, make it more robust to perform the tasks needed by all the service users in the organisation. You will join a network of like minded people who all see the value in sharing knowledge and saving money.

> We believe in sharing knowledge and want to give local authorities the opportunity to move away from costly contracts. Our system is available free of charge if you have internal capability or if you need support hosting or implementing, the cost will still be significantly less than your existing contract. In the current financial climate we all understand the importance of making budgets stretch further and empowering internal teams.
