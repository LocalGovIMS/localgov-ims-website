> This is an open, collaborative, local government project. It’s been funded by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing, and Communities’ (DLUHC) Local Digital Fund, and led collaboratively by partners.

The current partners on the project are Dorset Council, Barnsley Metropolitan and Borough Council and Lewisham Council. 

The partners are supported by a delivery partner, dxw and a DLUHC engagement manager. The team solves problems in collaboration with other councils, are in control of their systems and share a stake in a trusted, supportive community.



Richard Kingston, digital programme manager at Barnsley Council

“We initially created the system for our use at Barnsley, but to make this IMS something that other councils can use, we decided to build in other functionality too with the goal of making it open source. That way, we have an IMS that has been created by local government, for local government. We hope this is an approach that others can follow with different services”.

Glen Conroy, ICT operations manager at Dorset Council 

“People only notice an IMS when it’s not working. Either payments get taken, or they don’t. Having this in place will make a huge difference to the smooth running of the system in any council, ensuring the flow of payments from citizens and around the council is seamless and efficient”.
