> In addition to the current features of the IMS, a product backlog helps guide the further development of the system. 

Items on the backlog include:

* Enabling payment services
* Configuring the IMS for your needs
* Export line of business
* Enanching data imports (including reversals)
* Data outputs 
* Setting permissions based on a staff member’s role
* Reporting functionality

Backlog items will be progressed as the beta development of the IMS continues. If you’d like to be involved in shaping these features and adding to the development backlog please [get in touch with the IMS project team](/contacts).
